#Project Ideas

	1. Use a macro indicator, such as the US interest rate, and US BLS employment data to see if a specific demographic is more prone to job loss in times of economic downturn. This would be a useful piece of information because it could help assist in targeting retraining and unemployment assistance more efficiently.

	2. Use the "Wine Quality" data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality, to look at the chemical variances in Portuguese wines to see which attributes affect quality the most. The question that could be answered for this would be to help determine the future price of Portuguese wines by testing them as they age.

	3.Use the "Default of Credit Card Clients" data set, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients, to identify how each individual attribute individually, and in combination with each other, contribute to the perceived risk of a credit card client. With this I would hope to create a set of guidelines to offer to a prospective bank on how to target their credit offers.
